        <p>The main purpose of this interactive forum was also to familiarize participants with the 
            functioning of the parliament, which involves representing the electorate; making laws, and
             overseeing the government.  In fact, this platform teaches how legislators develop policies, 
             draft laws, and engage in discussions/ debates on matters that impact the lives of the people 
             of the country.</p>
