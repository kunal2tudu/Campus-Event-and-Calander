             embracing their profession with passion. Emphasizing upon the bliss in the culinary world, 
             Mrs Mittal also appreciated the creative spirit of the students. Mrs Mittal was accompanied 
             by invited guests, Head of the School and faculty members.

            world- from Tante Marie, Ashburton Cookery School, Chef Eric Periz and even Le Cordon Bleu.
