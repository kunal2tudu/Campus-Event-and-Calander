        <p>Keynote speaker, President Saudi Geographical Society, King Saud University, Riyadh Saudi Arabia; 
            Dr Ali Aldosaari shares that urban agriculture is essential for sustainable development as for

            land use due to urbanization causes, large-scale damage to agricultural land in the area. 
            In fact, urban agriculture is a fundamental environmental activity to ensure food security by 
            increasing food production for locals and improving urban biodiversity.</p>
